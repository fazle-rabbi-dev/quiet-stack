# Rules

- place contstants in `constants` folder
- place types in `@types` folder
- place validations in `validations` folder
- place utils, helpers, api config and other shared functions in `lib` folder
- place moduler stuffs in theri appropiate folder
- separate pkg import and custom file import by leaving a blank line between them

> 🚨 Important: Do not overengineer codebase by separating everything in different folders and files. Instead, focus on keeping things simple, readable, clean, and modular.

## Zustand Rules

- When subscribing up to 3 states, use individual selectors.
- When subscribing to more than three states, use the useShallow hook and return object + destructure 

## bad approach example

- for 2 input fields creating: arrays of objects, one for each field
- for few logic creating custom hooks for components.

## good approach example

- for 3 or more input fields creating: objects with keys for each field
- separate logic with custom hooks when component bloated with logic
